# HACKATHON PROJECT SUBMISSION DETAILS
I did all of my development in a repository that was instantiated from this template, however it seems like it's not straightforward to 
take that specific standalone repository and merge it back into a branch that is forked from this repository. As such, I will link to 
my repository HERE:
https://github.com/stshort/bookit

I have a functional MVP that is documented in the associated readme on that project. Please take a look through that repository - it has
all of the code, implementation details, and instructions to run the project included there. Unfortunately, at the time that I forked the
repository I neglected to notice the intent of the Makefile, so I really built this project quite manually, and it will require a bit 
of engineering work to spin it up locally, nothing too bad, but it will take some amount of time. If you have any questions on the
implementation, how to run it, or anything in general, please do reach out to me, and I will help clarify any questions or comments.
Even as review notes in the PR.
